# Set up Octane â›½

This guide assumes you have:

- a Mac/Linux/WSL environment to run basic shell commands
- a basic code editor
- a Github account
- a Vercel account
- Node.js 14.x (you can use [n](https://github.com/tj/n) to manage versions)
- the [Solana CLI Tools](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools) installed
- the [SPL Token CLI](https://spl.solana.com/token#command-line-utility) installed

If you don't have any of these yet, get them first!

## 1. Fork Octane on Github

Fork the project to create your own deployment of Octane.

![Github fork repo](setup/1_github_fork_repo.png)

## 2. Clone your fork

From your fork, copy the git link.

![Github clone fork](setup/2_github_clone_fork.png)

From the command line, run these commands:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/octane

cd octane

yarn install
# OR #
npm install
```

## 3. Configure the environment variables

From the command line, run this command:

```shell
cp packages/server/.env.example packages/server/.env
```

In your editor, open the `packages/server/.env` file.

![Edit .env file](setup/3_edit_env_file.png)

The values containing `__PLACEHOLDER__` need to be changed.

- `SECRET_KEY` is the base58 encoded secret key that Octane will sign transactions with.

Let's start by creating a keypair and minting a token to test with.

From the command line, run these commands:
```shell
solana-keygen new --no-bip39-passphrase --silent --outfile keys/octane.json

solana config set --keypair `pwd`/keys/octane.json --url https://api.devnet.solana.com

node base58.js `pwd`/keys/octane.json | pbcopy
```

The last command will silently copy the base58 encoded secret key to your clipboard.

Update the value of `SECRET_KEY` in your .env file with it, and save the file.

Now, open the `config.json` file.

These `__PLACEHOLDER__` values must also change.

- `mint` is the base58 encoded public key of an SPL token mint.
- `account` is the base58 encoded public key of an SPL token account corresponding to this mint.

From the command line, run these commands:
```shell
solana airdrop 1

spl-token create-token
```

After the last command, you should see:
```
Creating token <base58 encoded TRANSFER_MINT public key>
```

Copy this **TRANSFER_MINT** public key, update the value of `TRANSFER_MINT` in your `config.json` file with it, and save the file.

From the command line, run these commands:
```shell
source .env

spl-token create-account $TRANSFER_MINT

spl-token mint $TRANSFER_MINT 100
```

After the last command, you should see:
```
Minting 100 tokens
  Token: <base58 encoded TRANSFER_MINT public key>
  Recipient: <base58 encoded TRANSFER_ACCOUNT public key>
```

Copy this **TRANSFER_ACCOUNT** public key, update the value of `TRANSFER_ACCOUNT` in your `config.json` file with it, and save the file.

Now, commit and push your changes to the fork.

You're ready to deploy Octane.

## 4. Login to Vercel

Sign in with Github:

![Vercel login](setup/3_vercel_login.png)

## 5. Create a new project on Vercel

Click the **New Project** button:

![Vercel new project](setup/4_vercel_new_project.png)

## 6. Import your Octane fork

Click the **Import** button:

![Verce import repo](setup/5_vercel_import_repo.png)

## 7. Configure the project

You should see:

![Vercel configure project](setup/6_vercel_configure_project.png)

Edit the **Root Directory** section to `./packages/server`

Expand the *Build and Output Settings* section.

Under **Build Command**, toggle the slider for **Override** and put `cd ../.. && yarn build`.

Expand the **Environment Variables** section.

From your .env file, copy and paste the names and values of each environment variable and click the **Add** button.

When you're done, you should see:

![Vercel environment variables](setup/7_vercel_environment_variables.png)

## 8. Deploy the project

Click the **Deploy** button and wait. When the build is finished, you should see:

![Vercel congratulations](setup/8_vercel_congratulations.png)

Click the **Go to Dashboard** button.

## 9. Visit your deployment

Click the **Visit** button from the Dashboard.

![Vercel dashboard visit](setup/9_vercel_dashboard_visit.png)

You should see a blank page. This is the `index.html` file in the `public` directory. You can customize it if you like.

![Octane blank page](setup/10_octane_blank_page.png)

Navigate to the `/api` path of your deployment. You should see:

![Octane API index](setup/11_octane_api_index.png)

This is the `index` API route, which provides information about your deployment's configuration.

## 10. More coming soon

Sorry, this guide isn't finished yet! Octane is new, so please come back soon.
